# BucketList
 BucketList is a simple iOS app that allows users to save locations and view nearby Wikipedia articles. This app was built using Swift and SwiftUI and utilizes various iOS frameworks such as MapKit, LocalAuthentication, and URLSession.

## Features
- Users can save locations to a list that persists across app sessions.
- Users can edit existing locations by updating the name and description of the place.
- Users can authenticate using biometrics to access the app and view their saved locations.
- Users can view nearby Wikipedia articles related to the saved location.

## Usage
Upon launching the app, the user will be prompted to authenticate using biometrics before being granted access to their saved locations. Once authenticated, the user can view their saved locations on a map and click on a location to view more details or edit the location.
To add a new location, the user can press the "+" button on the map screen and a new location will be added to the list.
To edit an existing location, the user can click on a location on the map and press the "Edit" button to update the name and description of the location.
To view nearby Wikipedia articles, the user can click on a location on the map and scroll down to the "Near By..." section to view a list of related articles.
